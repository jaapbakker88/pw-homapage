<h2>Safety</h2>

<p>We aim to grow our community with fun and open-minded travelers and locals who love to party, but who party safely and are respectful of other users. Check out some of the safety measures we’ve taken and our recommended precautions below:</p>

<p><b>Profiles 🙋</b><br>
We suggest only meeting up with someone with a complete profile (bio, photos and party stats), so you can get a better feel for who they are before meeting up.</p>

<p><b>Reviews 📝</b><br>
Use past reviews to gauge whether the person you’re connecting with is someone you really want to meet.</p>

<p><b>Age restriction 🔞</b><br>
Users must be over the age of 18 to create a Party with a Local account.</p>

<p><b>Limited location sharing 🌎</b><br>
The app only provides a rough estimate your distance from a fellow user and never reveals your exact location.</p>

<p><b>Meet in public 🎡</b><br>
We always recommend meeting up in a public place. You can suggest nearby venues through the app and share the location of your chosen meeting place. This is safer than meeting at a stranger’s house which is potentially more dangerous (and awkward).</p>

<p><b>Safety in numbers 🐢🐒🐓</b><br>
Whilst the app is called ‘Party with A Local’, we encourage meeting up in groups and partying with multiple locals and/or travelers at the same time. The more the merrier, right?</p>

<p><b>Report a user 💩 ❌</b><br>
Party with a Local is not intended to be used as a dating app, so if you receive any inappropriate messages or see any dodgy profiles (sexist, racist or obviously looking to hook-up) then please do not hesitate to report a user. You can find ‘Report User’ at the bottom of a person’s profile.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">🚀 🍻 ⭐</p>

<p>Following these simple measures together with some common sense should ensure that you have only good experiences and meet great people using Party with a Local. 🤘</p>
