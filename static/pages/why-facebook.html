<h2>Why Facebook?</h2>

<p>Using Facebook to log in to Party with a Local helps to improve your experience:</p>

<ul style="line-height: 1.5em:">
    <li>It makes it quick and easy to sign up and start using Party with a Local straight away.</li>
    <li>We create your basic Party with a Local profile using some information from your Facebook account (e.g. your name, location, and gender), meaning that you only have to add a bio, photos and your party stats (all optional) in the app to have a complete profile.</li>
    <li>In terms of safety, it helps to us ensure that the people who join Party with a Local are who they say they are.</li>

</ul>
<p style="font-family: 'gotham_boldregular';">We never post anything to Facebook for you. ðŸ™…</p>
