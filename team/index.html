                                            <h4>What information do we collect?</h4>
                                            <p>When you use the PWAL app you will be asked to provide certain information about yourself including your name, birthday, age, email address, gender, Facebook ID, number of friends on Facebook hometown as well as your current location (this is something that the app reports back to the server directly). This information will hereinafter be referred to as Personal Information. By providing us with this information, you are giving us permission to use it as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                                            <p>We will never share your information with third parties without first receiving your explicit consent to do so.</p>

                                            <p>When you log on to the PWAL app, you do so via Facebook or with Email. How does that work? PWAL uses the Facebook platform to register new accounts, which accounts enable Users to log on to the PWAL app.</p>

                                            <p>When you log on via Facebook, Facebook provides us with the information you have given them.

By signing up with PWAL through the Facebook platform, you grant us permission to use the information listed in your Facebook profile.</p>

                                            <p>Please note that all information gathered by Facebook is governed by their privacy policy. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/privacy">Please click here to read Facebook’s registration and privacy policy</a>.</p>

                                            <h4>Information you share and information that is private</h4>
                                            <p>We will not publish all the information you give us. We will use your name, age, photo, current city/hometown, and number of friends on Facebook, to set up your profile. We will never share your precise GPS location, email address, Facebook ID and last login time with other users. You may, if you wish, place more information on the PWAL app itself. It is important for you to know that we have no control over the information you share with other Users, and you, as User must take great care when providing others with your contact details or other privacy-sensitive information. PWAL can never be held liable or responsible for the information you share with others.</p>

                                            <h4>Non-identifiable information</h4>
                                            <p>When you visit the PWAL website, you provide us with non-Identifiable information. PWAL stores general visitor data (statistics), such as, the most frequently visited screens, the total number of visitors and how visitors interact with the services/website. This information will not be used to identify you.</p>
                                            <p>We use cookies to analyze the information stored when you visit our website. A cookie is a small file stored on the hard disk of a computer.

                                            <p>Our PWAL app helps you find nearby Users and Venues. To do this we use the GPS coordinates on your mobile device and/ or the information on your hometown and current location as given in your Facebook profile. This information does not necessarily state your actual precise location or that of other users. Other Users might be right next to you, or miles away. You may edit the information about the location in the PWAL settings and/or Facebook profile settings.</p>
                                            <p>We use your GPS coordinates to determine your approximate current location. Other Users will never see your exact location. When you install the PWAL app, you grant us permission to use your GPS coordinates. You may revoke this permission by adjusting the PWAL app setting (disable GPS is possible within the Settings section of the More screen within the app).</p>
                                            <p>Your GPS coordinates are safe with us. The app sends your GPS coordinates to the server at regular intervals and each time it overwrites the previous GPS coordinates. The GPS location is securely stored in our database and is not accessible to anyone. We will never keep a record of your coordinates and never share your GPS location with anyone.</p>
